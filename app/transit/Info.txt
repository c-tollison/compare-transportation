Dependencies -- requests module.
py -m pip install requests
KEY.txt must contain the API key
    Nathan Edit - I took out the logic for KEY.txt because I couldn't 
        get it working with the flask server, so for now just put
        the API key in GoogleRoutes in place of the key variable.

to run:
py GoogleRoutes


Additional:
mode can be set to 
=driving
=walking
=bicycling
=transit (can be specified which transit, but that route may not exist)
To specify transit mode set transit_mode to bus, subway, train, tram, or rail.
